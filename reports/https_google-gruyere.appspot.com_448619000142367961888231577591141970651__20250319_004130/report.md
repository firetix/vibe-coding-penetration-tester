## Detailed Findings

### 1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in google-gruyere.appspot.com

**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
**Target:** https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/448619000142367961888231577591141970651/snippets.gtl?uid=cheddar  
**Validated:** No  

#### Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or phishing attacks.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a high impact, potentially allowing significant data exposure, partial application compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

#### Evidence

```
XSS payload is reflected unencoded in the page response
```

#### Remediation

Implement proper input validation and output encoding. Use context-specific encoding for different parts of the HTML document, and consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP).

### 3. Authentication/Session Vulnerability in Login and Sign up forms

**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Authentication/Session Vulnerability  
**Target:** Login and Sign up forms  
**Validated:** No  

#### Description

Session cookies are missing important security flags: Secure, SameSite.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a high impact, potentially allowing significant data exposure, partial application compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

#### Evidence

```
Cookie flags: HttpOnly=True, Secure=False, SameSite=False
```

#### Remediation

Set the HttpOnly flag to prevent client-side script access to cookies. Set the Secure flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS. Set the SameSite attribute to 'Lax' or 'Strict' to prevent CSRF attacks.
