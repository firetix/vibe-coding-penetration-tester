## Detailed Findings

### 1. SQL Injection in interaction with job-related URLs

**Severity:** Critical  
**Type:** SQL Injection  
**Target:** interaction with job-related URLs  
**Validated:** No  

#### Description

SQL Injection vulnerability found in url.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a critical impact, potentially allowing full system compromise, unauthorized access to highly sensitive data, or complete application takeover.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to https://prepair.dev/find-a-job
2. Insert the payload '; DROP TABLE users; -- into the url
3. Submit the form or trigger the action
4. Observe the error indicators

#### Evidence

```
Payload: '; DROP TABLE users; --
Detected using error method.
```

#### Remediation

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of dynamically building SQL queries. Implement proper input validation.

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in POST to /api/create-session

**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
**Target:** POST to /api/create-session  
**Validated:** No  

#### Description

Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability found in form unknown.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a high impact, potentially allowing significant data exposure, partial application compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to https://prepair.dev/api/create-session
2. Create a forged request that mimics the form submission
3. Submit the forged request from a different origin
4. Observe the request is processed without validation

#### Evidence

```
Form submission does not include CSRF token and does not validate origin or referer headers.
```

#### Remediation

Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations. Consider using the SameSite cookie attribute and requiring re-authentication for sensitive actions.

### 3. Authentication/Session Vulnerability in login and signup forms

**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Authentication/Session Vulnerability  
**Target:** login and signup forms  
**Validated:** Yes  

#### Description

Session cookies are missing important security flags: Secure, SameSite.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a high impact, potentially allowing significant data exposure, partial application compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

#### Evidence

```
Cookie flags: HttpOnly=True, Secure=False, SameSite=False
```

#### Remediation

Set the HttpOnly flag to prevent client-side script access to cookies. Set the Secure flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS. Set the SameSite attribute to 'Lax' or 'Strict' to prevent CSRF attacks.
