### 1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in snippets.gtl?uid

**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
**Target:** snippets.gtl?uid  
**Validated:** Yes  

#### Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or phishing attacks.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a high impact, potentially allowing significant data exposure, partial application compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

#### Evidence

```

### 2. Authentication/Session Vulnerability in sign in/sign up pages

**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Authentication/Session Vulnerability  
**Target:** sign in/sign up pages  
**Validated:** No  

#### Description

Session cookies are missing important security flags: Secure.

#### Impact

This vulnerability has a high impact, potentially allowing significant data exposure, partial application compromise, or unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

#### Evidence

```
Cookie flags: HttpOnly=True, Secure=False, SameSite=True
```

#### Remediation

Set the HttpOnly flag to prevent client-side script access to cookies. Set the Secure flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS. Set the SameSite attribute to 'Lax' or 'Strict' to prevent CSRF attacks.
