# VibePenTester Vercel Deployment Fix

This document provides information on the fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with VibePenTester on Vercel.

## Issue: Missing Flask-CORS Package

The error was:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/var/task/vc__handler__python.py", line 14, in <module>
__vc_spec.loader.exec_module(__vc_module)
File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 999, in exec_module

from web_api import create_app
File "/var/task/web_api/__init__.py", line 6, in <module>
from flask_cors import CORS
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_cors'
```

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Made Flask-CORS Optional**:
   - Updated both `web_api/__init__.py` and `web_ui.py` to gracefully handle missing Flask-CORS
   - Added fallback CORS implementation using Flask's `after_request` decorator

2. **Fixed Package Name in Requirements**:
   - Changed `flask_cors>=4.0.0` to `Flask-CORS>=4.0.0` in requirements-vercel.txt
   - The correct package name is "Flask-CORS", not "flask_cors"

3. **Improved Vercel Configuration**:
   - Updated vercel.json to explicitly set the installation command:
   ```json
   "config": {
     "installCommand": "pip install -r requirements-vercel.txt"
   }
   ```

4. **Enhanced Deployment Script**:
   - Updated the deploy-to-vercel.sh script to check for "Flask-CORS" with proper capitalization
   - Added more robust package requirement detection

## How These Changes Fix the Issue

The primary issue was that the Flask-CORS package was not being properly installed in the Vercel environment. This happened because:

1. The package name in requirements-vercel.txt used the underscore format (`flask_cors`) instead of the correct hyphenated format (`Flask-CORS`)
2. The application code had a hard dependency on Flask-CORS without any fallback mechanism

The fixes implement both the correct package name and a fallback mechanism in case the package is still missing. This approach ensures that the application will run in the Vercel environment regardless of whether Flask-CORS is successfully installed.

## Testing the Fix

After implementing these changes:

1. Deploy to Vercel using the deploy-to-vercel.sh script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-to-vercel.sh
   ```

2. If the deployment succeeds but still has issues, check the Vercel logs:
   ```bash
   vercel logs [your-app-url]
   ```

3. For full debugging, you can enable more verbose logging by setting the DEBUG environment variable:
   ```bash
   vercel env add DEBUG true
   ```

## Conclusion

These changes make the application more resilient to package installation issues in the Vercel environment by:
1. Using the correct package name syntax
2. Implementing an alternative CORS solution as a fallback
3. Explicitly setting the installation command in the Vercel configuration
