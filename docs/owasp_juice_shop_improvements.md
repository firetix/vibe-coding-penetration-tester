# OWASP Juice Shop Vulnerability Detection Improvements

This document outlines the enhancements made to the Vibe Penetration Tester to better identify vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop and other OWASP-vulnerable applications.

## Overview

OWASP Juice Shop is a deliberately vulnerable web application that contains all the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. We've enhanced the Vibe Penetration Tester to specifically target these vulnerabilities while maintaining generalizability to other web applications.

## Agent Improvements

### Authentication Agent

- Enhanced to detect SQL injection in login forms
- Added detection for default/weak credentials
- Improved checks for missing account lockout mechanisms
- Added detection for client-side authentication bypass
- Optimized for Juice Shop's authentication vulnerabilities
- Now checks if email is used as a password

### SQL Injection Agent

- Enhanced to identify authentication bypass in login forms
- Added specific payloads for Juice Shop's vulnerable endpoints
- Improved detection of data extraction via UNION queries
- Added detection for error-based SQL injection
- Improved identification of successful SQL injection exploits
- Added support for targeted injections to access specific user accounts

### XSS Agent (Pattern-Based Enhancement)

We completely redesigned the XSS agent with a pattern-based approach that excels at detecting Juice Shop XSS vulnerabilities:

- **Enhanced Context-Aware Detection**
  - Implemented specialized patterns for Juice Shop's vulnerable endpoints
  - Added detection for the search form reflected XSS vulnerability
  - Enhanced recognition of DOM-based XSS in Juice Shop's client-side code
  
- **Sanitization Bypass Detection**
  - Added specialized detection for the nested tags bypass (`<<script>`) required for the Tier 3 Challenge
  - Implemented pattern matching for sanitize-html 1.4.2 bypass techniques
  - Added detection for the "Perform a persisted XSS attack with `<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">` bypassing the sanitization" challenge
  
- **Reflection Analysis**
  - Enhanced detection for Juice Shop's vulnerable feedback form
  - Implemented automatic detection of successful XSS payload reflection
  - Added verification of script execution in Juice Shop's DOM environment
  
- **API-Based XSS Detection**
  - Added detection for direct API calls to POST /api/Feedbacks
  - Implemented client-side validation bypass detection for the feedback form
  - Enhanced detection for the Juice Shop API endpoints vulnerable to XSS

The pattern-based approach ensures our detection works not just on Juice Shop but on any application with similar vulnerability patterns.

### CSRF Agent

- Improved detection of missing CSRF tokens in forms
- Added support for identifying vulnerable redirect functionality
- Enhanced checks for SameSite cookie attributes
- Added specific checks for Juice Shop challenges like:
  - "Post feedback in another user's name"
  - "Wherever you go, there you are" (redirect challenge)

### IDOR Agent

- Added robust detection for accessing other users' baskets
- Enhanced identification of URL parameter manipulation
- Improved checks for unauthorized access to user profiles
- Added pattern recognition for sequentially incremented IDs
- Enhanced detection of successful unauthorized access

### SSRF Agent

- Implemented comprehensive pattern-based detection for SSRF vulnerabilities
- Added specific patterns for e-commerce applications like Juice Shop
- Enhanced identification of URL parameters and forms that process remote resources
- Improved recognition of obfuscated SSRF payloads and bypass techniques
- Added detection for:
  - Track order functionality that might process external URLs
  - Product image URLs that could be manipulated
  - B2B customer and supplier integrations
  - Delivery tracking features
  - Coupon redemption systems that may validate against external services
- Enhanced validation techniques to reduce false positives
- Added reporting of potential SSRF endpoints for manual verification

## Planner Agent Improvements

- Added specific testing plan for OWASP Juice Shop
- Enhanced system prompt with detailed Juice Shop vulnerability information
- Created prioritized testing strategies based on the Juice Shop walkthrough
- Added identification of Juice Shop URLs for specialized testing
- Implemented automatic challenge-based testing approach
- Added pattern-based testing for e-commerce platforms that's applicable beyond Juice Shop

## Testing Payloads

Added specific payloads known to work with Juice Shop:

- XSS: `<script>alert("XSS1")</script>` for reflected XSS
- XSS: `<<script>alert("XSS3")</script>script>alert("XSS3")<</script>/script>` for bypassing sanitization
- SQL Injection: `' OR 1=1;--` for authentication bypass
- SQL Injection: `') union select 1,email,password,4,5,6,7 from users;--` for data extraction
- IDOR: Manipulation of basket IDs to access others' baskets
- CSRF: Missing token detection in profile and feedback forms
- Redirects: NULL byte injection with `%00` to bypass URL validation
- SSRF: `http://localhost:3000/administration` for internal service access
- SSRF: `file:///etc/passwd` for local file access
- SSRF: IP obfuscation like `http://0177.0.0.1:3000/administration`

## Integration Testing

We've added specific integration tests to validate our improvements:

- Tests for XSS detection in various contexts
- Tests for SQL injection in login forms
- Tests for CSRF token validation
- Tests for IDOR pattern recognition
- Tests for SSRF detection and validation

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

1. Add support for more Juice Shop challenges (e.g. file upload vulnerabilities)
2. Enhance reporting to map findings to specific OWASP Top 10 categories
3. Improve automation of challenge-specific exploits
4. Add support for JWT token vulnerabilities
5. Enhance password hash cracking capabilities
6. Improve detection of business logic flaws
7. Implement blind SSRF detection with external callback servers
8. Add more sophisticated validation for server-side vulnerabilities

## Usage

To test OWASP Juice Shop with the enhanced Vibe Penetration Tester:

```bash
python main.py --url https://demo.owasp-juice.shop --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
```

The pen tester will automatically identify the target as Juice Shop and apply the specialized testing approach with tailored payloads and detection strategies. For advanced testing focusing on SSRF:

```bash
python main.py --url https://demo.owasp-juice.shop --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 --agent ssrf
```

This will run only the SSRF agent on the target application to focus on server-side request forgery vulnerabilities.

To specifically target XSS vulnerabilities in Juice Shop:

```bash
python main.py --url https://demo.owasp-juice.shop --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 --agent xss
```

This will deploy our enhanced pattern-based XSS detection agent against Juice Shop, focusing on all types of XSS vulnerabilities including the challenging sanitization bypass techniques.
