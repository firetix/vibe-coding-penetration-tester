# VibePenTester Web UI

The VibePenTester Web UI provides a modern, intuitive interface for running security tests against web applications. The interface allows you to:

1. Enter a target URL to scan
2. Monitor real-time progress of the security scan
3. View a formatted security report with highlighted vulnerabilities
4. Download the report for sharing or documentation

## Screenshots

A screenshot of the UI would show:

- A clean, modern interface with a blue header
- A form for entering the target URL
- A real-time progress bar showing the scanning progress
- A results panel showing the security findings, formatted with syntax highlighting
- Download and new scan buttons

## Usage Workflow

1. The user enters a URL in the input field and clicks "Start Security Scan"
2. The UI shows a progress bar and current task information
3. Upon completion, the security report is displayed with discovered vulnerabilities
4. The user can download the report or start a new scan

This web UI makes security testing accessible to users who prefer a graphical interface over command-line tools.
