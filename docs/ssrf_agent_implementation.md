# SSRF Agent Implementation for Vibe Pen Tester

## Overview

The Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) agent is a specialized security agent designed to detect SSRF vulnerabilities in web applications. SSRF vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can induce a server to make requests to unintended locations due to inadequate validation of user-supplied input.

## Implementation Details

The SSRFAgent is implemented as an extension of the `SpecializedSecurityAgent` base class with enhanced capabilities to:

1. Identify potential SSRF entry points by analyzing URLs, form fields, and API endpoints
2. Detect SSRF vulnerabilities through pattern-based testing
3. Validate findings through multiple evidence types
4. Generate comprehensive reports including potential vulnerable endpoints

## Key Features

### Pattern-Based Detection

The SSRF agent uses pattern recognition to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities across different types of web applications, focusing on:

- URL parameters that might process remote resources (url, uri, path, file, etc.)
- API endpoints that might fetch external resources
- Input fields that accept URLs
- Common SSRF vectors in e-commerce and other application types

### Enhanced Payload Recognition

The agent recognizes a wide range of SSRF payloads and obfuscation techniques:

- Basic internal targets (localhost, 127.0.0.1, etc.)
- IP address obfuscation (decimal, octal, hexadecimal encodings)
- Alternative protocol handlers (file://, gopher://, etc.)
- Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, etc.)
- URL encoding and other bypass techniques

### Multiple Evidence Sources

The agent validates SSRF vulnerabilities through several evidence types:

- Direct indicators in response content
- HTML or JSON responses containing internal information
- Error messages revealing connection attempts
- Timing-based detection
- Consistent pattern matching across responses

### Contextual Analysis

The agent analyzes the application context to optimize detection:

- URL structure and parameter analysis
- Tracking of potential SSRF endpoints for comprehensive reporting
- Identification of application-specific SSRF patterns

## Testing Methodology

The SSRF agent follows a comprehensive testing methodology:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Analyze URLs, parameters, and form fields to identify potential SSRF entry points
2. **Payload Testing**: Use a variety of payloads targeting internal services, cloud metadata, and local files
3. **Evidence Collection**: Gather response data to identify successful SSRF exploitation
4. **Validation**: Confirm findings through multiple evidence types to reduce false positives
5. **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with vulnerability evidence and remediation recommendations

## OWASP Juice Shop Integration

The agent includes specific patterns known to exist in OWASP Juice Shop and similar e-commerce applications:

- Track order functionality that might process external URLs
- Product image URLs that could be manipulated
- B2B customer and supplier integrations
- Delivery tracking features
- Coupon redemption systems that may validate against external services

## Reporting and Remediation

For identified vulnerabilities, the agent provides:

- Detailed vulnerability information including severity and evidence
- The specific injection point and payload used
- Recommendations for fixing the vulnerability using allowlist-based approaches
- Additional potential SSRF endpoints that should be investigated

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:

1. Integration with external callback servers for blind SSRF detection
2. More sophisticated protocol-specific payload generation
3. Enhanced correlation between different evidence types
4. Advanced IP address obfuscation detection
5. Better context-aware payload selection based on application type
