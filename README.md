# Vibe Penetration Tester  üéØ

**Vibe Coding**? Cool story. But your vibe might be "security breach waiting to happen." Introducing VibePenTester, the AI pen-tester who rolls its eyes at your half-baked code, discovers your vulnerabilities faster than your coworkers discover free pizza, and gently bullies your web app into compliance. Less "vibe check," more "reality check."

## üåü Key Features

- **Intelligent Vulnerability Discovery**: Uses LLMs (OpenAI and Anthropic Claude) to understand application context and identify potential security weaknesses (and your career weaknesses too)
- **Advanced Payload Generation**: Creates sophisticated test payloads tailored to the target application (more creative than your dating app profile)
- **Context-Aware Testing**: Analyzes application behavior and responses to guide testing strategy (unlike your ex who never listened)
- **Automated Exploit Verification**: Validates findings to eliminate false positives (we wish dating apps had this feature)
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed vulnerability reports with reproduction steps (that even your manager can understand)
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Optional discovery of related subdomains (finds all your app's secret hangout spots)
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Built-in proxy captures and analyzes all web traffic (like that one friend who knows all the gossip)
- **Expandable Scope**: Option to recursively test discovered URLs (goes down rabbit holes so you don't have to)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (like your coffee, best when hot and fresh)
- OpenAI API key (for using OpenAI models)
- Anthropic API key (optional, for using Claude models)
- Playwright (no actual playwright experience required)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (like stealing someone's homework, but legal)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibe_pen_tester.git
cd vibe_pen_tester

# Install dependencies (the digital equivalent of assembling IKEA furniture)
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic scan of a single URL (for commitment-phobes)
python main.py --url https://example.com

# Advanced scan with subdomain enumeration and URL discovery (OpenAI)
python main.py --url https://example.com --scope subdomain --model gpt-4o

# Using Anthropic Claude models (for the AI hipsters)
python main.py --url https://example.com --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

# Using Anthropic Claude with extended thinking capabilities (when you want it to overthink like you do)
python main.py --url https://example.com --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-latest --scope domain

# Using faster Anthropic Claude model (for the impatient security professionals)
python main.py --url https://example.com --provider anthropic --model claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

### Web Interface

For a graphical interface (because command lines are so 1980s), run:

```bash
python web_ui.py
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050)

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--url` | Target URL to test (required, unless you want to test the void) |
| `--scope` | Scan scope (url, domain, or subdomain, default: url) |
| `--provider` | LLM provider to use (openai or anthropic, default: openai) |
| `--model` | LLM model to use (OpenAI: gpt-4o; Anthropic: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219, claude-3-7-sonnet-latest, claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) |
| `--output` | Output directory for results (where the digital dirt gets stored) |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging (for those who enjoy reading horror stories in real-time) |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

VibePenTester is built with a modular architecture consisting of several key components (like a well-designed sandwich):

- **OpenAI Swarm**: The backbone of our multi-agent system, leveraging OpenAI's powerful swarm architecture to coordinate multiple specialized agents (it's like The Avengers, but for hacking)
- **SwarmCoordinator**: Orchestrates the scanning process and manages other components (the micromanager you actually want)
- **LLMProvider**: Unified interface to different LLM providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) (the universal translator of AI dialects)
- **Scanner**: Handles web page interaction and data collection (digital detective with OCD)
- **Agents**: Specialized security testing agents focusing on different aspects
  - Discovery agents for URL and attack surface identification (the nosy neighbors of the internet)
  - Security testing agents for specific vulnerability types (specialized in judging your code choices)
- **Tools**: Collection of testing and exploitation tools (like a Swiss Army knife, but for breaking things ethically)
- **Proxy**: Monitors and captures network traffic (the internet equivalent of reading someone's diary)
- **Reporter**: Analyzes findings and generates detailed reports (turns chaos into PowerPoint-ready content)

## üìä Example Report

Reports are generated in both text and markdown formats, containing:

- Executive summary (for people who don't read past the first paragraph)
- Detailed findings with severity ratings (from "meh" to "update your resume")
- Technical details and reproduction steps (so detailed even your intern can understand)
- Evidence and impact analysis (proof that we're not making this up)
- Remediation recommendations (how to fix your life...err, code)

## üîí Security Considerations

- Always obtain proper authorization before testing (breaking and entering is only cool in movies)
- Use responsibly and ethically (don't be that person)
- Follow security testing best practices (like washing hands, but for hacking)
- Be mindful of potential impact on target systems (they have feelings too...sort of)

## üìã TODOs

- [x] Add support for Anthropic Claude models
- [ ] Integrate vision API capabilities for visual analysis
- [ ] Run against HackerOne reports to find first LLM-powered vulnerability in the wild
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated planning algorithms
- [ ] Add better execution strategies and error handling
- [ ] Support for custom LLM model deployment
- [ ] Add collaborative testing capabilities
- [ ] Improve subdomain enumeration techniques
- [ ] Add API security testing capabilities
- [x] Add basic documentation and examples

## üõ°Ô∏è OWASP Top 10 Coverage

We're working hard to cover all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, but we need your help! Currently, we have decent coverage for:

- ‚úÖ Injection (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
- ‚úÖ Broken Authentication
- ‚úÖ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ‚úÖ Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) 
- ‚úÖ Security Misconfiguration

But we still need help with:

- ‚ùå Broken Access Control (advanced scenarios)
- ‚ùå Cryptographic Failures (comprehensive detection)
- ‚ùå Insecure Design patterns
- ‚ùå Software and Data Integrity Failures
- ‚ùå Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) detection improvements

If you're knowledgeable in these areas, we desperately need your contributions! Help us make the internet slightly less terrible, one fixed vulnerability at a time. Your expertise could save countless developers from embarrassing security incidents and awkward conversations with their CISOs.
