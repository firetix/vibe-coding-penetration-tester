# Session Management and Browser Navigation Fix

## Problem

The application had an issue where security agent activities, action plans, and the current agent task loading bar were not being displayed in the UI when deploying the agent swarm. This was due to two main issues:

1. **Session Management Issue**: Session IDs were not consistently maintained between the frontend and backend, causing activities to be stored with one session ID but retrieved with a different one.
2. **Browser Navigation Errors**: The scanning process was failing on some websites due to timeouts and navigation errors.

## Solution

### Session Management Fix

1. **Flask Session Cookies**: Added Flask session cookie support to maintain session persistence.
2. **Cookie-Based Session Tracking**: Modified the session initialization process to prioritize cookie-based sessions over request parameters.
3. **Persistent Session Storage**: Implemented file-based session persistence to maintain sessions between server restarts.
4. **Frontend Session Initialization**: Updated the frontend to properly initialize sessions through a server endpoint.
5. **Enhanced Auto-Create Session Decorator**: Modified the decorator to handle multiple session ID sources with proper prioritization.

### Browser Navigation and Error Handling

1. **Increased Timeouts**: Increased default timeouts from 30,000ms to up to 120,000ms for slower websites.
2. **Progressive Fallbacks**: Implemented cascading fallbacks for navigation from networkidle to domcontentloaded to commit.
3. **Modern User Agents**: Added modern user agent rotation for better website compatibility.
4. **JavaScript Error Handling**: Added event listeners to capture and log JavaScript errors on loaded pages.
5. **Retry Logic**: Added comprehensive retry logic with different strategies for page loading.
6. **Improved Network Idle Handling**: Enhanced the network idle detection with better fallback mechanisms.

### Code Improvements

1. **Better Error Logging**: Enhanced error logging throughout the application.
2. **Activity Verification**: Added explicit verification of activity tracking to ensure it's working correctly.
3. **Test Activities**: Added test activities to verify activity tracking functionality.
4. **Session Validation**: Improved session validation with detailed logging.
5. **Fixed JavaScript Disabling**: Fixed a syntax error with async/await by using the synchronous Playwright API correctly.
6. **Added Missing Imports**: Added missing imports like the time module.

## Testing

The changes were tested by:

1. Running the application and verifying that sessions are maintained between requests.
2. Confirming that agent activities are properly displayed in the UI.
3. Testing navigation to websites with potential timeout issues.
4. Verifying that the improved error handling handles navigation failures gracefully.
5. Checking that sessions persist even after server restarts.
